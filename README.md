## About project

This is a Web App for creating and taking the courses. Here is a web API that helps you interact with a database that stores courses data, and the client side to create and take courses (log in, create and complete lessons, upload and watch videos, take tests).
 
<!---More about business logic, database schema, component diagram you can see in [design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bEvHXDxrGMU5eWxjBdT6eoA5OIkL18bKe9ypRxkODgo/edit?usp=sharing). --->

[Deployed App](https://plan-znoshnika.fly.dev/course).

But to run the project locally see "How to run".

## How to run
- first of all, you need to install [.Net 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) (if you do not already have it)
- open this folder in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- run the following command to install all needed packages

Now you're ready to start.
If you want to **run the app**:

- run Docker desktop and the following command to create postgres database

<code>$ docker run --name devCourse -e POSTGRES_USER=appuser -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret -p 5432:5432 -d postgres:latest</code>

- go to API folder, set 6 user-secrets: 3 for Cloudinary (that stores videos) and 3 for Stripe (is used for payments), and run the API:

<code>$ cd API</code></br>
<code>$ dotnet user-secrets set "\<KeyName\>" "\<Value\>"</code></br>

<img width="800" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a1edc76-3b14-43cc-a8d8-5ff177cb05fb"></br>
<code>$ dotnet restore </code></br>
<code>$ dotnet run</code>

- then open another terminal and run client side using the following commands:

<code>$ cd client</code></br>
<code>$ npm install</code></br>
<code>$ npm start</code>

After that, the home page of the app will be opened in your browser.

### 2) Creating a Course

> Managing courses is allowed only to users with "Admin" role. They have "Редагувати курси" tab on the top bar.

Here you can create a new course or edit some.

![image](https://github.com/yaryna-bashchak/maths-course/assets/90560209/de204bf4-dbe8-48f3-8edc-aafda6a6c4fc)

You can change any information, create new sections, lessons and so on.

### Adaptive Design

The app is also adapted to smaller devices such as a phone or tablet. For example, for smaller screens, a side menu appears in the header, which repeats the same buttons that are on the large screens.
The content of the pages is also appropriate.

### Web API

If you want to test how the Web API works it would be enough to run only API folder (see "How to run").

- then open [http://localhost:5000/swagger](http://localhost:5000/swagger) in your browser and try to use some endpoints to get or change data in database.

<img src='https://github.com/yaryna-bashchak/maths-course/assets/90560209/f9867e92-b506-4ea7-8096-152be02fe9ad' width='600'>

Example of getting _lesson by id_, where you can see information about the lesson, as well as a list of keywords and lessons that are recommended to be completed/repeated before.

### Tests
If you want to **run tests** (you also can see that all tests are passed in [_Github Actions_](https://github.com/yaryna-bashchak/maths-course/actions))

- go back to the root folder maths-course if you are not there
- run the following command

<code>$ dotnet test ./API.Tests</code>

Example:
